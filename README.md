# ARCHETYPE | Global Creative Agency Website Kit

**ARCHETYPE** is a high-performance, minimalist website template designed for creative agencies, consultancies, and design studios. It features a bold editorial aesthetic inspired by top-tier global networks (e.g., Ogilvy), utilizing advanced CSS Grid layouts and crisp typography without the need for JavaScript or heavy frameworks.

## 🚀 Features

* **Zero Dependencies:** Built entirely with **HTML5 & CSS3**. No JavaScript, Bootstrap, or Tailwind required.
* **Internal CSS:** Each page is self-contained with its own `<style>` block for easy portability and editing.
* **Advanced Layouts:**
* **Masonry Grid:** Fluid image galleries that respect natural aspect ratios (Home Page).
* **Bento Grid:** Asymmetric magazine-style layouts (Intelligence Page).


* **Responsive Design:** Fully fluid layouts that adapt from desktop to mobile screens.

* **SVG Graphics:** Custom SVG logos and icons for sharp resolution on all devices.
